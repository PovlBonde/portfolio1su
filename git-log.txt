    SQL implemented
    
    Everything should run smoothly with the SQLite3 database structure. Dungeon and weapon logic has been updated, but not balanced. Quality of life changes has been made as well. Everything looks as though it fullfils the demands. Awaiting testing

    Save & Load implemented. Dungeon logic updated
    
    It is now possible to save between dungeons. Gold is now a part of hero stats. When a dungeon is defeated, it shows in game, and should save in the code as well, and unlock the dragon when all dungeons has been defeated.

    Save and load
    
     Created save and load features as well as adjusted the bossfight. Next up: make the attacks a bit random so the game is not the same each time.

    Fighting sequence update
    
    Fighting sequence is almost finished. The whole thing is wrapped in a loop, allowing the player to go through the enemies in self-picked order. Created option to check stats of hero, and updated level-up system. Now all that needs is a balance of heroes, dragon fight and SQL implementation.

    Updated UI and fighting sequence
    
    Added linespaces between options in UI, to make everyting more readable. The fighting sequence now have a (4 second) timer inbetween actions. A vector has been made to store enemies in, and enemies should be deleted when defeated. The whole enemy interaction should be wrapped in a loop to let the player go through all of the enemies.

    Created fighting sequence
    
    At the moment it just spams the entire fight. Make it so that there is a timer, and show the health of the hero as well as enemy. The enemy also needs to be placed in an array, so that it can be removed from the list of enemies. There still needs to be a level up system
